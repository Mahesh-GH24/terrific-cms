   ## Challenges
   During the project, I ran into issues with Git and was unable to push to Github and it was resolved after troubleshooting. Otherwise writing all the different queries was little time taking.

   ## Tests
   Ensure the app opens and ensure each of the menu options works successfully and produces the desired results.

   ## Future Implementation
   Expand this to React FE and migrate to Model view of architecture rather than writing SQL's
